This repository contains a Javascript bug that demonstrates the unexpected behavior of Javascript's type coercion when performing addition operations with numbers and strings.The bug is demonstrated in the file `bug.js`, and a solution is provided in the file `bugSolution.js`.The solution uses explicit type conversion to ensure that both operands are numbers before performing the addition.
